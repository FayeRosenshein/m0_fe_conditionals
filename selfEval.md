# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
  * I feel pretty confident but I still am struggling with a few typos when I am writing instead of copy/paste the code.

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
  *I am confident in my understanding of the logical operators but I would not say I am fluent yet

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
  * I am confident in my understanding but not yet on my fluency with if statements

1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
  * I spent a few hours in total on this with a few hours inbetween me working on this, so I feel OK with this work because I took a break in the middle to allow myself to relax before going again
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
  * I think I just need to keep practicing the things we have gone over. I am confident that I understand but not that I can do it myself without looking through my notes. I will probably allow more time for each and give myself longer breaks too
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
  * I don't have anymore questions on this assignment but if I did I would go to my small chat first, then ask the big chat and then I would ask Kaitlyn for help
